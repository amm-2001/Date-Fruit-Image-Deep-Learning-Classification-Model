# Date Fruit Image Deep Learning Classification Model
Saudi Arabia is known for its various types of date fruits, including Ajwa, Medjool, Nabtat Ali, and more. For this project, I have developed and implemented a deep learning-based image classification system using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed to classify date images.

The architecture I used is based on the TensorFlow tutorial on image classification (link: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification). This architecture is well-suited for image classification tasks. The model comprises several layers, including a convolutional layer for extracting features, max pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification. These layers take the output from the previous layer, which represents a high-level image representation, and apply weights to make the final prediction. To activate the model, I utilized the ReLU activation function, which is widely used in deep learning and has shown good performance in practical applications. The model is trained using supervised learning, where labeled images are used to determine the network's parameters.
